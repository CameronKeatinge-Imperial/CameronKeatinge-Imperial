## Hi, Cameron here! :star:

I am a Master's student at **Imperial** studying Statistics (2025/26).

I studied my undergraduate at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. I look forward to collaborating, please feel free to say hi! My email is cjk25@ic.ac.uk.

Outside of statistics, I enjoy cooking and spending time with friends.
I also enjoy sports, including:
- Cricket
- Rugby
- Football
