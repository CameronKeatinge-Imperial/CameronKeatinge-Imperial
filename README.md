## Hi, Cameron hear!

I am a Master's student at Imperial studying Statistics (2025/26).

I studied my undergraduate at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. I look forward to collaborating, please feel free to say hi!

Outside of statistics, I enjoy cooking and spending time with friends.
I also enjoy sports, including:
- Cricket
- Rugby
- Football
